   <h1 align="center">¡Hey! Soy emiliorb👋🏼</h1>
</p>

I am Emilio Rodriguez, a 19-year-old student currently pursuing a degree in Information and Communication Technology Engineering for Business. I am passionate about

technology and focus on developing web and mobile applications as well as graphic and web design.

From a young age, I had a great curiosity for new technologies and quickly discovered an interest in the world of programming. I have always been fascinated by how

applications and websites can improve people's lives and make businesses operate more efficiently.
